# XaeroPlus
Xaero runtime modifications

This is still WIP. 

Xaero WorldMap version: XaerosWorldMap_1.26.2_Forge_1.12

Xaero Minimap version: Xaeros_Minimap_22.13.0_Forge_1.12

# Modifications

* WorldMap zoom unlocked
* WorldMap and Waypoint directories are indexed by Multiplayer server name instead of IP
* Increase speed of loading minimap and worldmap regions on world/dimension change.
  * Most noticeable when you have 50k+ regions per dimension

# WIP


* Improve WorldMap performance with very small zooms
  * With the unlocked zoom, loading many regions in view is very time (and VRAM) intensive.
